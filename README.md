An in-depth tutorial is available on the [ros_flask wiki](https://github.com/stoddabr/ros_flask/wiki/Tutorial)

# Basic Quickstart

After setting up ROS catkin and making, run this:
```bash
roslaunch flask_ros start_server.launch
```

For more information view the flask_ask_ros repo linked below.

# Limitations

* Flask HTML templates don't seem to work.
See /src/html.py for used workaround for providing html responses.
This could be an issue with how ROS manages directories. -- NOTE: I have actually fixed this on another project but am too lazy to update things here. If someone wants this create an issue and I'll update this repo
